Good-by, feet! Oh, my poor little feet, I wonder who will put on your shoes and stockings for you now, dears? I shall be a great deal too far off to trouble myself about you.’</span></p><p>Just at this moment her head struck against the roof of the hall; in fact, she was now rather more than nine feet high, and she at once took up the little golden key and hurried off to the garden door.</p><p>Poor <span class="name">Alice</span>! It was as much as she could do, lying down on one side, to look through into the garden with one eye; but to get through was more hopeless than ever. She sat down and began to cry again.</p><p>She went on shedding gallons of tears, until there was a large pool all 'round her and reaching half down the hall.</p><p>After a time, she heard a little pattering of feet in the distance and she hastily dried her eyes to see what was coming. It was the <span class="name">White Rabbit</span> returning, splendidly dressed, with a pair of white kid-gloves in one hand and a large fan in the other. He came trotting along in a great hurry, muttering to himself, <span class="quote">‘Oh! the <span class="name">Duchess</span>, the <span class="name">Duchess</span>! Oh! <em>won't</em> she be savage if I've kept her waiting!’</span></p><span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d29e129">[Page]</span><p>When the <span class="name">Rabbit</span> came near her, <span class="name">Alice</span> began, in a low, timid voice, <span class="quote">‘If you please, sir—’</span> The <span class="name">Rabbit</span> started violently, dropped the white kid-gloves and the fan and skurried away into the darkness as hard as he could go.</p><p><span class="name">Alice</span> took up the fan and gloves and she kept fanning herself all the time she went on talking. <span class="quote">‘Dear, dear! How queer everything is to-day! And yesterday things went on just as usual. <em>Was</em> I the same when I got up this morning? But if I'm not the same, the next question is, 'Who in the world am I?' Ah, <em>that's</em> the great puzzle!’</span></p><p>As she said this, she looked down at her hands and was surprised to see that she had put on one of the <span class="name">Rabbit's</span> little white kid-gloves while she was talking. <span class="quote">‘How <em>can</em> I have done that?’</span> she thought. <span class="quote">‘I must be growing small again.’</span> She got up and went to the table to measure herself by it and found that she was now about two feet high and was going on shrinking rapidly. She soon found out that the cause of this was the fan she was holding and she dropped it hastily, just in time to save herself from shrinking away altogether.</p><span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d29e165">[Page]</span><p><span class="quote">‘That <em>was</em> a narrow escape!’</span> said <span class="name">Alice</span>, a good deal frightened at the sudden change, but very glad to find herself still in existence. <span class="quote">‘And now for the garden!’</span> And she ran with all speed back to the little door; but, alas! the little door was shut again and the little golden key was lying on the glass table as before. <span class="quote">‘Things are worse than ever,’</span> thought the poor child, <span class="quote">‘for I never was so small as this before, never!’</span></p><p>As she said these words, her foot slipped, and in another moment, splash! she was up to her chin in salt-water. Her first idea was that she had somehow fallen into the sea. However, she soon made out that she was in the pool of tears which she had wept when she was nine feet high.</p><p>Just then she heard something splashing about in the pool a little way off, and she swam nearer to see what it was: she soon made out that it was only a mouse that had slipped in like herself.</p><span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d29e185">[Page]</span><p><span class="quote">‘Would it be of any use, now,’</span> thought <span class="name">Alice</span>, <span class="quote">‘to speak to this mouse? Everything is so out-of-the-way down here that I should think very likely it can talk; at any rate, there's no harm in trying.’</span> So she began, <span class="quote">‘O <span class="name">Mouse</span>, do you know the way out of this pool? I am very tired of swimming about here, O <span class="name">Mouse</span>!’</span> The <span class="name">Mouse</span> looked at her rather inquisitively and seemed to her to wink with one of its little eyes, but it said nothing.</p><p><span class="quote">‘Perhaps it doesn't understand English,’</span> thought <span class="name">Alice</span>. <span class="quote">‘I dare say it's a French mouse, come over with William the Conqueror.’</span> So she began again: <span class="quote">‘Où est ma chatte?’</span> which was the first sentence in her French lesson-book. The <span class="name">Mouse</span> gave a sudden leap out of the water and seemed to quiver all over with fright. <span class="quote">‘Oh, I beg your pardon!’</span> cried <span class="name">Alice</span> hastily, afraid that she had hurt the poor animal's feelings. <span class="quote">‘I quite forgot you didn't like cats.’</span></p><p><span class="quote">‘Not like cats!’</span> cried the <span class="name">Mouse</span> in a shrill, passionate voice. <span class="quote">‘Would <em>you</em> like cats, if you were me?’</span></p><p><span class="quote">‘Well, perhaps not,’</span> said <span class="name">Alice</span> in a soothing tone; <span class="quote">‘don't be angry about it. And yet I wish I could show you our cat Dinah. I think you'd take a fancy to cats, if you could only see her. She is such a dear, quiet thing.’</span> The <span class="name">Mouse</span> was bristling all over and she felt certain it must be really offended. <span class="quote">‘We won't talk about her any more, if you'd rather not.’</span></p><p><span class="quote">‘We, indeed!’</span> cried the <span class="name">Mouse</span>, who was trembling down to the end of its tail. <span class="quote">‘As if I would talk on such a subject! Our family always <em>hated</em> cats—nasty, low, vulgar things! Don't let me hear the name again!’</span></p><span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d29e258">[Page]</span><p><span class="quote">‘I won't indeed!’</span> said <span class="name">Alice</span>, in a great hurry to change the subject of conversation. <span class="quote">‘Are you—are you fond—of—of dogs? There is such a nice little dog near our house, I should like to show you! It kills all the rats and—oh, dear!’</span> cried Alice in a sorrowful tone. <span class="quote">‘I'm afraid I've offended it again!’</span> For the <span class="name">Mouse</span> was swimming away from her as hard as it could go, and making quite a commotion in the pool as it went.</p><p>So she called softly after it, <span class="quote">‘<span class="name">Mouse</span> dear! Do come back again, and we won't talk about cats, or dogs either, if you don't like them!’</span> When the <span class="name">Mouse</span> heard this, it turned 'round and swam slowly back to her; its face was quite pale, and it said, in a low, trembling voice, <span class="quote">‘Let us get to the shore and then I'll tell you my history and you'll understand why it is I hate cats and dogs.’</span></p><p>It was high time to go, for the pool was getting quite crowded with the birds and animals that had fallen into it; there were a <span class="name">Duck</span> and a <span class="name">Dodo</span>, a <span class="name">Lory</span> and an <span class="name">Eaglet</span>, and several other curious creatures. <span class="name">Alice</span> led the way and the whole party swam to the shore.</p></div><div class="chapter" id="index.xml-body.1_div1.2"><h2><span class="headingNumber">2. </span><span class="head">THE RABBIT SENDS IN A LITTLE BILL</span></h2><p>It was the <span class="name">Rabbit</span>, trotting slowly back again and looking anxiously about as it went, as if it had lost something; Alice heard it muttering to itself, <span class="quote">‘The <span class="name">Duchess</span>! The <span class="name">Duchess</span>! Oh, my dear paws! Oh, my fur and whiskers! She'll get me executed, as sure as ferrets are ferrets! Where <em>can</em> I have dropped them, I wonder?’</span> <span class="name">Alice</span> guessed in a moment that it was looking for the fan and the pair of white kid-gloves and she very good-naturedly began hunting about for them, but they were nowhere to be seen—everything seemed to have changed since her swim in the pool, and the great hall, with the glass table and the little door, had vanished completely.</p><span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d29e322">[Page]</span><p>Very soon the <span class="name">Rabbit</span> noticed <span class="name">Alice</span>, and called to her, in an angry tone, <span class="quote">‘Why, Mary Ann, what <em>are</em> you doing out here? Run home this moment and fetch me a pair of gloves and a fan! Quick, now!’</span></p><p><span class="quote">‘He took me for his housemaid!’</span> said <span class="name">Alice</span>, as she ran off. <span class="quote">‘How surprised he'll be when he finds out who I am!’</span> As she said this, she came upon a neat little house, on the door of which was a bright brass plate with the name <span class="quote">‘W. RABBIT’</span> engraved upon it. She went in without knocking and hurried upstairs, in great fear lest she should meet the real Mary Ann and be turned out of the house before she had found the fan and gloves.</p><p>By this time, <span class="name">Alice</span> had found her way into a tidy little room with a table in the window, and on it a fan and two or three pairs of tiny white kid-gloves; she took up the fan and a pair of the gloves and was just going to leave the room, when her eyes fell upon a little bottle that stood near the looking-glass. She uncorked it and put it to her lips, saying to herself, <span class="quote">‘I do hope it'll make me grow large again, for, really, I'm quite tired of being such a tiny little thing!’</span></p><p>Before she had drunk half the bottle, she found her head pressing against the ceiling, and had to stoop to save her neck from being broken. She hastily put down the bottle, remarking, <span class="quote">‘That's quite enough—I hope I sha'n't grow any more.’</span></p><p>Alas! It was too late to wish that! She went on growing and growing and very soon she had to kneel down on the floor. Still she went on growing, and, as a last resource, she put one arm out of the window and one foot up the chimney, and said to herself, <span class="quote">‘Now I can do no more, whatever happens. What <em>will</em> become of me?’</span></p><span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d29e364">[Page]</span><p>Luckily for <span class="name">Alice</span>, the little magic bottle had now had its full effect and she grew no larger. After a few minutes she heard a voice outside and stopped to listen.</p><p><span class="quote">‘Mary Ann! Mary Ann!’</span> said the voice. <span class="quote">‘Fetch me my gloves this moment!’</span> Then came a little pattering of feet on the stairs. <span class="name">Alice</span> knew it was the <span class="name">Rabbit</span> coming to look for her and she trembled till she shook the house, quite forgetting that she was now about a thousand times as large as the <span class="name">Rabbit</span> and had no reason to be afraid of it.</p><p>Presently the <span class="name">Rabbit</span> came up to the door and tried to open it; but as the door opened inwards and <span class="name">Alice</span>'s elbow was pressed hard against it, that attempt proved a failure. <span class="name">Alice</span> heard it say to itself, <span class="quote">‘Then I'll go 'round and get in at the window.’</span></p><p><span class="said">‘<em>That</em> you won't!’</span> thought <span class="name">Alice</span>; and after waiting till she fancied she heard the <span class="name">Rabbit</span> just under the window, she suddenly spread out her hand and made a snatch in the air. She did not get hold of anything, but she heard a little shriek and a fall and a crash of broken glass, from which she concluded that it was just possible it had fallen into a cucumber-frame or something of that sort.</p><p>Next came an angry voice—the <span class="name">Rabbit</span>'s—<span class="quote">‘Pat! Pat! Where are you?’</span> And then a voice she had never heard before, <span class="quote">‘Sure then, I'm here! Digging for apples, yer honor!’</span></p><p><span class="quote">‘Here! Come and help me out of this! Now tell me, Pat, what's that in the window?’</span></p><p><span class="quote">‘Sure, it's an arm, yer honor!’</span></p><p><span class="quote">‘Well, it's got no business there, at any rate; go and take it away!’</span></p><p>There was a long silence after this and <span class="name">Alice</span> could only hear whispers now and then, and at last she spread out her hand again and made another snatch in the air. This time there were <em>two</em> little shrieks and more sounds of broken glass. <span class="quote">‘I wonder what they'll do next!’</span> thought <span class="name">Alice</span>. <span class="quote">‘As for pulling me out of the window, I only wish they <em>could!</em>’</span></p><p>She waited for some time without hearing anything more. At last came a rumbling of little cart-wheels and the sound of a good many voices all talking together. She made out the words: <span class="quote">‘Where's the other ladder? Bill's got the other—Bill! Here, Bill! Will the roof bear?—Who's to go down the chimney?—Nay, <em>I</em> sha'n't! <em>You</em> do it! Here, Bill! The master says you've got to go down the chimney!’</span></p><p><span class="name">Alice</span> drew her foot as far down the chimney as she could and waited till she heard a little animal scratching and scrambling about in the chimney close above her; then she gave one sharp kick and waited to see what would happen next.</p><p>The first thing she heard was a general chorus of <span class="quote">‘There goes Bill!’</span> then the <span class="name">Rabbit</span>'s voice alone—<span class="quote">‘Catch him, you by the hedge!’</span> Then silence and then another confusion of voices—<span class="quote">‘Hold up his head—Brandy now—Don't choke him—What happened to you?’</span></p><p>Last came a little feeble, squeaking voice, <span class="quote">‘Well, I hardly know—No more, thank ye. I'm better now—all I know is, something comes at me like a Jack-in-the-box and up I goes like a sky-rocket!’</span></p><p>After a minute or two of silence, they began moving about again, and <span class="name">Alice</span> heard the <span class="name">Rabbit</span> say, <span class="quote">‘A barrowful will do, to begin with.’</span></p><p><span class="quote">‘A barrowful of <em>what</em>?’</span> thought <span class="name">Alice</span>. But she had not long to doubt, for the next moment a shower of little pebbles came rattling in at the window and some of them hit her in the face. <span class="name">Alice</span> noticed, with some surprise, that the pebbles were all turning into little cakes as they lay on the floor and a bright idea came into her head. <span class="quote">‘If I eat one of these cakes,’</span> she thought, <span class="quote">‘it's sure to make <em>some</em> change in my size.’</span></p><p>So she swallowed one of the cakes and was delighted to find that she began shrinking directly. As soon as she was small enough to get through the door, she ran out of the house and found quite a crowd of little animals and birds waiting outside. They all made a rush at <span class="name">Alice</span> the moment she appeared, but she ran off as hard as she could and soon found herself safe in a thick wood.</p><p>The <span class="name">Duchess</span> tucked her arm affectionately into <span class="name">Alice</span>'s.</p><p><span class="quote">‘The first thing I've got to do,’</span> said <span class="name">Alice</span> to herself, as she wandered about in the wood, <span class="quote">‘is to grow to my right size again; and the second thing is to find my way into that lovely garden. I suppose I ought to eat or drink something or other, but the great question is 'What?'’</span></p><p><span class="name">Alice</span> looked all around her at the flowers and the blades of grass, but she could not see anything that looked like the right thing to eat or drink under the circumstances. There was a large mushroom growing near her, about the same height as herself. She stretched herself up on tiptoe and peeped over the edge and her eyes immediately met those of a large blue caterpillar, that was sitting on the top, with its arms folded, quietly smoking a long hookah and taking not the smallest notice of her or of anything else.</p><span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d29e515">[Page]</span></div><div class="chapter" id="index.xml-body.1_div1.3"><h2><span class="headingNumber">3. </span><span class="head">ADVICE FROM A CATERPILLAR</span></h2><p>At last the <span class="name">Caterpillar</span> took the hookah out of its mouth and addressed <span class="name">Alice</span> in a languid, sleepy voice.</p><p><span class="quote">‘Who are <em>you</em> ?’</span>said the <span class="name">Caterpillar</span>.</p><p><span class="name">Alice</span> replied, rather shyly, <span class="quote">‘I—I hardly know, sir, just at present—at least I know who I was when I got up this morning, but I think I must have changed several times since then.’</span></p><p><span class="quote">‘What do you mean by that?’</span> said the <span class="name">Caterpillar</span>, sternly. <span class="quote">‘Explain yourself!’</span></p><span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d29e547">[Page]</span><p><span class="quote">‘I can't explain <em>myself</em>, I'm afraid, sir,’</span> said <span class="name">Alice</span>, <span class="quote">‘because I'm not myself, you see—being so many different sizes in a day is very confusing.’</span> She drew herself up and said very gravely, <span class="quote">‘I think you ought to tell me who <em>you</em> are, first.’</span></p><p><span class="quote">‘Why?’</span> said the <span class="name">Caterpillar</span>.</p><p>As <span class="name">Alice</span> could not think of any good reason and the <span class="name">Caterpillar</span> seemed to be in a <em>very</em> unpleasant state of mind, she turned away.</p><p><span class="quote">‘Come back!’</span> the <span class="name">Caterpillar</span> called after her. <span class="quote">‘I've something important to say!’</span> <span class="name">Alice</span> turned and came back again.</p><p><span class="quote">‘Keep your temper’</span>, said the <span class="name">Caterpillar</span>.</p><p><span class="quote">‘Is that all?’</span> said <span class="name">Alice</span>, swallowing down her anger as well as she could.</p><p><span class="quote">‘No’</span>, said the <span class="name">Caterpillar</span>.</p><p>It unfolded its arms, took the hookah out of its mouth again, and said, <span class="quote">‘So you think you're changed, do you?’</span></p><p><span class="quote">‘I'm afraid, I am, sir,’</span> said <span class="name">Alice</span>. <span class="quote">‘I can't remember things as I used—and I don't keep the same size for ten minutes together!’</span></p><p><span class="quote">‘What size do you want to be?’</span> asked the <span class="name">Caterpillar</span>.</p><p><span class="quote">‘Oh, I'm not particular as to size,’</span> <span class="name">Alice</span> hastily replied, <span class="quote">‘only one doesn't like changing so often, you know. I should like to be a <em>little</em> larger, sir, if you wouldn't mind,’</span> said <span class="name">Alice</span>. <span class="quote">‘Three inches is such a wretched height to be.’</span></p><p><span class="quote">‘It is a very good height indeed!’</span> said the <span class="name">Caterpillar</span> angrily, rearing itself upright as it spoke (it was exactly three inches high).</p><span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d29e646">[Page]</span><p>In a minute or two, the <span class="name">Caterpillar</span> got down off the mushroom and crawled away into the grass, merely remarking, as it went, <span class="quote">‘One side will make you grow taller, and the other side will make you grow shorter.’</span></p><p><span class="quote">‘One side of <em>what</em>? The other side of <em>what</em>?’</span> thought <span class="name">Alice</span> to herself.</p><p><span class="quote">‘Of the mushroom,’</span> said the <span class="name">Caterpillar</span>, just as if she had asked it aloud; and in another moment, it was out of sight.</p><p><span class="name">Alice</span> remained looking thoughtfully at the mushroom for a minute, trying to make out which were the two sides of it. At last she stretched her arms 'round it as far as they would go, and broke off a bit of the edge with each hand.</p><p><span class="quote">‘And now which is which?’</span> she said to herself, and nibbled a little of the right-hand bit to try the effect. The next moment she felt a violent blow underneath her chin—it had struck her foot!</p><p>She was a good deal frightened by this very sudden change, as she was shrinking rapidly; so she set to work at once to eat some of the other bit. Her chin was pressed so closely against her foot that there was hardly room to open her mouth; but she did it at last and managed to swallow a morsel of the left-hand bit....</p><p><span class="quote">‘Come, my head's free at last!’</span> said <span class="name">Alice</span>; but all she could see, when she looked down, was an immense length of neck, which seemed to rise like a stalk out of a sea of green leaves that lay far below her.</p><p><span class="quote">‘Where <em>have</em> my shoulders got to? And oh, my poor hands, how is it I can't see you?’</span> She was delighted to find that her neck would bend about easily in any direction, like a <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d29e692">[Page]</span>serpent. She had just succeeded in curving it down into a graceful zigzag and was going to dive in among the leaves, when a sharp hiss made her draw back in a hurry—a large pigeon had flown into her face and was beating her violently with its wings.</p><p><span class="quote">‘Serpent!’</span> cried the <span class="name">Pigeon</span>.</p><p><span class="quote">‘I'm <em>not</em> a serpent!’</span>I said <span class="name">Alice</span> indignantly. <span class="quote">‘Let me alone!’</span></p><p><span class="quote">‘I've tried the roots of trees, and I've tried banks, and I've tried hedges,’</span> the <span class="name">Pigeon</span> went on, <span class="quote">‘but those serpents! There's no pleasing them!’</span></p><p><span class="name">Alice</span> was more and more puzzled.</p><p><span class="quote">‘As if it wasn't trouble enough hatching the eggs,’</span> said the <span class="name">Pigeon</span>, <span class="quote">‘but I must be on the look-out for serpents, night and day! And just as I'd taken the highest tree in the wood,’</span> continued the <span class="name">Pigeon</span>, raising its voice to a shriek, <span class="quote">‘and just as I was thinking I should be free of them at last, they must needs come wriggling down from the sky! Ugh, Serpent!’</span></p><p><span class="quote">‘But I'm <em>not</em> a serpent, I tell you!’</span> said <span class="name">Alice</span>. <span class="quote">‘I'm a—I'm a—I'm a little girl,’</span> she added rather doubtfully, as she remembered the number of <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d29e744">[Page]</span>changes she had gone through that day.</p><p><span class="quote">‘You're looking for eggs, I know <em>that</em> well enough,’</span> said the <span class="name">Pigeon</span>; <span class="quote">‘and what does it matter to me whether you're a little girl or a serpent?’</span></p><p><span class="quote">‘It matters a good deal to <em>me</em>,’</span> said <span class="name">Alice</span> hastily; <span class="quote">‘but I'm not looking for eggs, as it happens, and if I was, I shouldn't want <em>yours</em>—I don't like them raw.’</span></p><p><span class="quote">‘Well, be off, then!’</span> said the <span class="name">Pigeon</span> in a sulky tone, as it settled down again into its nest. <span class="name">Alice</span> crouched down among the trees as well as she could, for her neck kept getting entangled among the branches, and every now and then she had to stop and untwist it. After awhile she remembered that she still held the pieces of mushroom in her hands, and she set to work very carefully, nibbling first at one and then at the other, and growing sometimes taller and sometimes shorter, until she had succeeded in bringing herself down to her usual height.</p><p>It was so long since she had been anything near the right size that it felt quite strange at first. <span class="quote">‘The next thing is to get into that beautiful garden—how is that to be done, I wonder?’</span> As she said this, she came suddenly upon an open place, with a little house in it about four feet high. <span class="quote">‘Whoever lives there,’</span> thought <span class="name">Alice</span>, <span class="quote">‘it'll never do to come upon them <em>this</em> size; why, I should frighten them out of their wits!’</span> She did not venture to go near the house till she had brought herself down to nine inches high.</p><span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d29e793">[Page]</span></div><!--TEI back--><div class="stdfooter autogenerated"><div class="footer"><!--standard links to project, institution etc--><a class="plain" href="/">Home</a> </div><address>Carroll, Lewis, 1832-1898..
